## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### What is Software Engineering and Why is it Important?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

### Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution
1. **1950s-60s: Birth of Software Engineering** – The term "software engineering" was introduced to address the software crisis.
2. **1970s-80s: Structured Programming** – Emphasis on modular design and structured coding to improve maintainability.
3. **1990s-Present: Agile & DevOps** – Shift towards iterative development and continuous integration for faster delivery.

### Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. **Requirement Analysis** – Gather and document user needs.
2. **Design** – Plan system architecture and interface.
3. **Implementation** – Write and integrate code.
4. **Testing** – Verify functionality and fix bugs.
5. **Deployment** – Release software for users.
6. **Maintenance** – Provide updates and improvements.

### Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies
- **Waterfall**: Linear approach, each phase must be completed before the next begins. Suitable for projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government contracts.
- **Agile**: Iterative approach, allowing flexibility and frequent feedback. Best for evolving projects (e.g., startups developing new products).

### Roles in a Software Engineering Team
- **Software Developer**: Writes and maintains code.
- **Quality Assurance Engineer**: Tests software to find and fix defects.
- **Project Manager**: Plans and oversees project execution.

### Importance of IDEs and Version Control Systems
- **IDEs**: Tools like VS Code and IntelliJ streamline coding with debugging and automation.
- **Version Control Systems**: Tools like Git track changes, enable collaboration, and prevent data loss.

### Common Challenges in Software Engineering and Solutions
1. **Changing Requirements** Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. **Tight Deadlines** Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. **Technical Debt** Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

### Types of Testing in Software Quality Assurance
- Effective communication
- Agile methodologies
- Prioritization of tasks
- Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### What is Prompt Engineering and Why is it Important?
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs for AI models to produce accurate and useful responses. 

### Example of Improving a Prompt
- **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about AI."
- **Improved Prompt**: "Explain AI in simple terms, including its key applications in healthcare and finance."
- **Why it’s Better**: The improved prompt is specific, guiding the AI to provide relevant and structured information.
